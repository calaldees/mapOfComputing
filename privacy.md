Privacy
=======

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
<sub>Edward Snowden</sub>

* Do you want your money to be secure when you bank online. Of course you do. So you want encryption!

* [Privacy matters even if “you have nothing to hide”](https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide)
    * > We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.

    * osx Big Su 2020 - Every app load MUST contact apple. This is unencrypted and apple can refuse to launch your app
    * [Does Apple really log every app you run? A technical look](https://blog.jacopo.io/en/post/apple-ocsp/) - it just sends developer certificate
    * _Developer certificate_ isn't quite as bad as _app hash_, but it still makes apple gatekeeper and can hold other companies to ransom

Windows 10 "Welcome to your new machine" .. No, it's mine .. I get to welcome you to it .. I dislike the wording.

    * The EU want encryption (for their own industry, commerce, population) .. but at the same time don't want encryption because they want to fight crime and things they think are against their interests.

Censorship
----------

    * Marketing/Advertising, what's the difference between that and public manipulation?
    * In the old days
        * people choose their name/identity
        * people were there by choice - nobody needed to be on the internet to get a job
    * Increasingly Competitive and commercial space as governments and companies moved in. A space less for the individual
    * Decentralised ot centralised
    * Even if you setup your own email server - when you send an email - google has a copy of it because the recipients have gmail accounts
    * No process - if your gmail account goes - your stranded - you are not a google customer
    * there is already a law for if you incite volence that you go to court - more power?
    * the emotionaly charged game - if you don't give us these powers you agree with pedophila or terrorisum
    * how many pedophiles and terrorists are there?
    * preasure can be applied to companies. Compaines can go beyond what the law affords and take action against these minority groups. Compaines are advertising platoforms and have to bow to pressure.
    * If you don't trust the govenment to make these descisions, then why would you trust companies? Companies can change without elections are and largely out of your control
    * influence == power
