    * Open Graph, Microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD.

    * If you asked, “all songs before 1995 that failed domestically but were well-received worldwide,” you would be unlikely to get results because no one has yet answered that question. The data for such a query exists on the web; however, it is not readily available due to how search works.
