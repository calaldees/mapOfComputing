Project Management
==================

* Forbes [Why No One Can Manage Projects, Especially Technology Projects](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2020/12/01/why-no-one-can-manage-projects-especially-technology-projects/) 2020 Steve Andriole
    * > All of the software, tools and management elixirs in the world will not save project management. 
      > Only people can save project management
    * > All of our efforts to avoid technology project failures can be simplified if we focus primarily on the humans who plan, fund and execute technology projects.
    * > Gartner was ‘too conservative’ with its 60% estimate.  The real failure rate?  ‘closer to 85 percent.’  In other words, abandon hope all ye who enter here, especially because "the problem isn't technology," Heudecker said.  It's you.”
    * > Because experienced project managers know just who to recruit for their next projects.
    * > Leadership must occur at all levels: corporate, LOB, CFO, CIO, CTO, CISO and teams. Is technology project management cultural?  Absolutely. Companies must embrace and reward project management.  They must find and reward leaders – and punish those that cannot lead by clearing their project slates
    * > Companies are well aware of their leadership problems.  Very few have an abundance of good leaders; hardly any have a cadre of great ones
