    * > Code, we say, can be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, a hack, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like a poem.
    * > Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.
