    * > There are three common complaints against social media and the internet in general: 1) that it’s making us all narcissistic and shallow 2) that it’s crapping on our ability to maintain meaningful relationships and therefore making us lonelier and 3) that it’s interfering with our ability to focus and get quote, unquote “more important shit” done in our lives.
      > Interestingly, after quite a bit of research, it turns out that none of these claims are completely accurate. Social media doesn’t necessarily cause people to become more narcissistic, it just gives narcissistic people more opportunities to indulge their narcissism, and to a larger audience.

    * the Dark Triad of Web UI Design Choices that addict people to social media and drive us all slowly crazy (by design!):
        * Relative timestamps (“3 hours ago” instead of “6:56 PM”). This creates IMMEDIACY.
        * Infinite scrolling with no “more” button or link. This creates PERPETUATION.
        * Fake internet points (clickable, often animated icons with incrementing numbers. Likes, reactions, upvotes, retweets, etc.). This creates ADDICTION.
