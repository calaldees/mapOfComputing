* [feather.wiki](https://feather.wiki/)
    * is an app for creating personal non-linear notebooks, databases, and wikis that is entirely self-contained and runs in your browser. 
    * The app and all of the content you create using it are stored within the single HTML file generated when you save your wiki. 
    * Publishing your content for the world to see is as simple as uploading that file to a web server, and updating is as simple as overwriting the file.
