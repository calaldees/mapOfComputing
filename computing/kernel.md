Kernel
======

* [Linux Kernel Map](https://makelinux.github.io/kernel/map/)

* [Why mmap is faster than system calls](https://sasha-f.medium.com/why-mmap-is-faster-than-system-calls-24718e75ab37)
    * Great explanation of what syscalls are
* [Discovering and exploring mmap using Go](https://brunocalza.me/2021/01/10/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/)
    * [[golang]]

* [[translation-layer]]

* [The growing image-processor unpleasantness](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/904776/aa7224d94a7c43c0/)
    * Modern processors have hardware image processing modules `IPU6 `. Linux drivers are hard to do. Existing API's `V4L2 ` need reworking for new features `KCAM`. Intel do not release how to interface with this hardware (probably because they outsourced the module to another company and don't have the rights to it). This will take many years for Linux to support it.

WindowsNT
---------

* [Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential](https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html)
    * WSL1 translated linux calls to windows calls and had a single kernal
        * You could see linux process's in the windows process tree
    * WSL2 is just a co-resident kernel (a separate vm)
    * [[bsd]] did the translation layer years ago in reverse
