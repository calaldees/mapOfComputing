    * >  I designed the 12-bit rainbow palette for use in my data visualisations. It consists of twelve colours chosen with consideration for how we perceive hue, chroma, and luminance:

* [Color Formats in CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/color-formats/) [[css]]
    * > CSS has a whole slew of different color formats: hex codes, rgb(), hsl(), lch(), the list goes on!
    * > Developer Anthony Lieuallen created this neat demo, showing all 140 named web colors in a circle:
        * It's mad jumbled!
    * HSL vs. HSB
    * P3!? (differnt green and red curves)
    * ```css
        .box {
             background: color(display-p3 1 0 0);
        }
        ```
    * LCH
        * > LCH is a color format that aims to be perceptually uniform to humans. Two colors with an equivalent “lightness” value should feel equally light!
        * ```css
            .box {
                 background-color: lch(50% 100 0);
            }
            ```
        * > Unlike the other color formats we've seen, LCH isn't bound to sRGB. It isn't even bound to P3! It achieves this by not having an upper limit on Chroma.
    * > Personally, I recommend using HSL. At least until LCH gains widespread browser support.
