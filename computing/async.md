Async
=====

* `async` is a language feature for performing concurrency in single threaded languages

* [Asyncio, twisted, tornado, gevent walk into a bar... they pay, they leave, they drink, they order.](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/asyncio-twisted-tornado-gevent-walk)
    * Great explanation of #concurrency in python with 3 different methods
        * -
            * concurrency is having two lines of customers ordering from a one cashier
            * parallelism is having two lines of customers ordering from two cashiers
        * Example of fetching 10 urls
* [I'm not feeling the async pressure](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/) - Backpressure (python3 dose not have it)
* [Async Python is not faster](http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html)

    `asyncio.run`.

> Note the difference in units: nanoseconds for a regular synchronous function call, microseconds to start an event loop, run a coroutine, and then shut the event loop down again.
> In the other direction, the overhead of using asyncio.to_thread to run synchronous APIs in an async context is lower than that of using asyncio.run in a synchronous context (since the event loop sets up and manages a thread executor that lives as long as the event loop does), but itâ€™s still not negligible (one order of magnitude for a do-nothing function rather than the 3 orders of magnitude we saw with asyncio.run):
