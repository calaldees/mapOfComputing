Random Number Generation
========================

Algorithm?


True Random
-----------

Lava lamps
Radio tellescope telematry
geigher counter

Linux block and wait for enough random data


Joe's Fibonachi algorithum
--------------------------

uint16 - uses overflow
Golang and Javascript
Take index 3 and 7 of rolling data

Tests using Monti carlo - 
put points in 2D space - check in square or cirlce - should get pi as ratio - good because each point individually is counted (no need for huge store of data) - O(n) time
