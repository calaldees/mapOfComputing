Continuous Integration
======================

What is it
Why is it important
Example

Running tests on multiple nodes and combining
Code coverage - reject to lower
pre-commit hooks
code format
* [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
    * A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages
    * [[technical-language]]
Downstream jobs
Human interaction (authorisation to deploy server or push to app store)
Develop (cooking pot)
Merge restricted (process of approval)
Squash feature commits
    bisect
Artifacts (test reports - audit)
Metrics from Jira
    ticket duration
    feature duration
    story points per sprint
    Cyclomatic complexity
    NOT Lines of Code! (be careful what you measure)
    NOT for the business - a tool for the developers to make judgements
* [[technical-dept]]
Run tests in paralall on CI and merge results (split alphabetically)

CI + Tests - we dont need to ask permission/approval all the time - we've automated it


* [glci](https://github.com/mdubourg001/glci)
    * Ease GitLab CI Pipelines set-up by running your jobs locally in Docker containers.
* [pre-commit.com/hooks](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html)
* [GitHub Actions Limitations and Gotchas](https://www.cbui.dev/github-actions-limitations-and-gotchas/)

* [Database Lab Engine (DLE)](https://github.com/postgres-ai/database-lab-engine)
    * Thin #PostgreSQL clones. DLE provides blazing fast database cloning to build powerful development, test, QA, staging environments. Follow to stay updated.
    * Uses ZFS overlays for 1TB large database's


TODO: 
* [Introducing Dagger: a new way to create CI/CD pipelines](https://dagger.io/blog/public-launch-announcement)

* [R2Devops](https://r2devops.io/)
    * The open source CI/CD hub for smooth developments
