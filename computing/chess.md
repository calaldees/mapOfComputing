    * > This paper is concerned with the problem of constructing a computing routine or "program" for a modern general purpose computer which will enable it to play chess. Although perhaps of no practical importance, the question is of theoretical interest, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of a similar nature and of greater significance. Some possibilities in this direction are: -
        * (1)Machines for designing filters, equalizers, etc.
        * (2)Machines for designing relay and switching circuits.
        * (3)Machines which will handle routing of telephone calls based on the individual circumstances rather than by fixed patterns.
        * (4)Machines for performing symbolic (non-numerical) mathematical operations.
        * (5)Machines capable of translating from one language to another.
        * (6)Machines for making strategic decisions in simplified military operations.
        * (7)Machines capable of orchestrating a melody.
        * (8)Machines capable of logical deduction.
    * Shannon is a god-damn visionary!
