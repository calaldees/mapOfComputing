Just use memory?

Redis?
200ms loss
Mongo(ohno)db
My(els)SQL -> MariaDB
Elastic Search (stemming -> plurals)
File system
S3?

Relication (cascade)

Test your backups

[[postgresql]]

in browser

Activity Idea
-------------

generate SQL database relations and data based off a student name hash.
Ask questions (with known results)
Mark SQL compitence (no cheating)

* [geocode-sqlite](https://github.com/eyeseast/geocode-sqlite) - Geocode rows in a SQLite database table
    * take address and use web api to get lat/lon

Immutable - Zero Trust
----------------------

Object Relational Model (ORM) #orm
-----------------------

* [prisma.io](https://www.prisma.io/)
    * Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM
    * Prisma helps app developers build faster and make fewer errors with an open source database toolkit for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.

Moving away from database api to data layer
-------------------------------------------

[[nosql]]

* [NoneSQL, All the DevEx](https://planetscale.com/blog/nonesql-all-the-devex)
    * Most products today are database focused
    * Database internals will eventually just not matter
    * Moving towards [[developer-experience]]
        * Migrations
        * Version control (for data)
        * user management

* [fauna.com](https://fauna.com/)
    * The data API for modern applications
    * Fauna is a flexible, developer-friendly, transactional database delivered as a secure and scalable cloud API with native GraphQL. Never again worry about database provisioning, scaling, sharding, replication, or correctness.
    * Think data, not database operations
