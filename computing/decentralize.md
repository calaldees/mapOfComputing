Decentralize
============

* [Why decentralization matters](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters)
    * “Web 3”: the third era of the internet
    * > Decentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.
    * > An illustrative analogy Wikipedia (decentralised) vs Encarta (centralised). in 2000, Encarta was a far better product ... Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate ... active community. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most popular reference. Encarta was shut down in 2009.

    * Great dissection of _trust_ in smart contracts and crypto
    * _oracles_ give real work data into the ethereum network (these need trust)
    * Smart contracts can be flawed

    * Description of crypto, email, web, git, irc/discord, rss, bittorrent
    * Decentralised system fail because they don't make money

    * Local rules instead of global censorship
    * Fediverse? decentralised twitter - like email is decentralised

* [Around the Web 〜 RSS as a Facebook Alternative](https://thenewleafjournal.com/around-the-web-rss-as-a-facebook-alternative/)
    * Federated social media platforms
    * [[rss]] [[social-media]]

* [Paid in Full](https://reallifemag.com/paid-in-full/) - The emerging dream of an internet where every interaction is a financial transaction
    * > “Free” content on centralizing platforms is monetized, but most of the money flows directly from advertisers to the platforms themselves. Social media decoupled fame and fortune
    * > The more decentralized apps of Web3 will not necessarily look and feel different but will allow mechanisms like crowdfunding to be incorporated directly into works themselves. Interactions will become transactions
* [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)
    * The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data.
