    * Modern OS's are too complex
    * Constantly writing state to system drives
    * Couple to physical drive
    * Multiboot a problem
    * Applications and OS mixed together
    * Applications as one folder
    * Mutiple versions of an application useable
    * No passwords by default
    * Offline by default
* [End User Programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html)
    * > Todayâ€™s software apps are like appliances: we can only use the capabilities exactly as programmed by the developer. What if we, and all computer users, could reach in and modify our favorite apps? Or even create new apps on the fly according to our needs in the moment?
    * > despite forty years of commercial products, open source, and deep academic work, we have yet to reach an end-user programming utopia. In fact, the opposite: today our computing devices are less programmable and less customizable than ever before.
