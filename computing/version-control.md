What is a DIFF - example needed

* [How Microsoft reduced Windows 11 update size by 40%](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/how-microsoft-reduced-windows-11-update-size-by-40/ba-p/2839794)
    * Binary diffs

Version control for smaller increments
--------------------------------------

* [Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago?](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/yestercode.html)
    * We often undo and redo in batches while refactoring
    * with undo/redo we don't know where we are int history and we cant easily visualise the changes
    * wouldn't it be good to have a timeline slider for actions
