AI (Artificial Intelligence)
============================

* The elephant in the room in many education settings.
* Mass public misunderstanding
* TODO this section needs fleshing out MASSIVELY!

* [Summary of Envisioning AI for K-12: What should every child know about AI?](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/summary-of-what-should-every-child-know-about-ai/)

radiologists move to differnt hospital - ai cant be transfered

* [Coding Challenge #158: Shape Classifier Neural Network with ml5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqJzMvHE3E) Coding Train 36min
    * He trains a network himself with drawing shapes and it recognises shapes drawn on paper!
    * This could be an AMAZING activity
        * What about training the algorithm with lines - and then trying to recognise a filled circle. Could this be a powerful lesson in the data we tain algorithms with? (like the issues big tech companies had with recognising black faces with login systems)

* [Explaining Machine Learning Predictions](https://explainml-tutorial.github.io/) - State-of-the-art, Challenges, and Opportunities
    * [Explainable Machine Learning: Understanding the Limits & Pushing the Boundaries](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn2dCDAeEEhB_rex202KxMPqIPj31fZ4/view) Hima Lakkaraju


* [Machine Learning: The Great Stagnation](https://marksaroufim.substack.com/p/machine-learning-the-great-stagnation)
    * (I need to read up on AI and matrix's in general)
    * The writer talks about AI research in general stagnating - there are some interesting AI research out there

* [What I Wish Someone Had Told Me About Tensor Computation Libraries](https://eigenfoo.xyz/tensor-computation-libraries/)

* [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver)
    * Explore the concepts and methods used in modern reinforcement learning research.
    * 10 part course

* [Uppestcase and Lowestcase Letters](http://tom7.org/lowercase/) 12min
    * Using [[ai]] to find the uppercase of an uppercase letter and the lowercase of a lowercase letter.
    * Some really ugly font output
    * Really well described video

* [Ai mid 2021. Self driving car meets reality](https://blog.piekniewski.info/2021/05/12/ai-mid-2021/)
    * Size of dataset. In one city it works. It wont work across the world with different vehicles and terrain
    * AI better than radiologists ... but move it the hospital down the road, with slightly different imaging and it  wont work and needs to be retrained from scratch, where as a radiologist can just walk down the road.

* [The computers rejecting your job application](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55932977)
    * Frankly, it was a little stressful to know that my application was being judged by a computer and not by a human being.
    * A professional journalist, I had recently applied for a new job, and for the first part of the recruitment process the publisher made me play a number of simple online games from the comfort of my own home. These included having to quickly count the number of dots in two boxes, inflating a balloon before it burst to win money, and matching emotions to facial expressions. 
    * Then an artificial intelligence (AI) software system assessed my personality, and either passed or failed me. No human had a look-in.
    * I wondered: is it fair for a computer alone to accept or reject your job application?
