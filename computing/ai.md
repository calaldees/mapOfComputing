    * Amazingly clear article!
    * Knowing how models like Claude think would allow us to have a better understanding of their abilities, as well as help us ensure that they’re doing what we intend them to. For example:
        * Claude can speak dozens of languages. What language, if any, is it using "in its head"?
        * Claude writes text one word at a time. Is it only focusing on predicting the next word or does it ever plan ahead?
        * Claude can write out its reasoning step-by-step. Does this explanation represent the actual steps it took to get to an answer, or is it sometimes fabricating a plausible argument for a foregone conclusion?
    * We take inspiration from the field of neuroscience, which has long studied the messy insides of thinking organisms, and try to build a kind of AI microscope that will let us identify patterns of activity and flows of information. There are limits to what you can learn just by talking to an AI model—after all, humans (even neuroscientists) don't know all the details of how our own brains work. So we look inside.

    * 29 March 2023, the UK government published its whitepaper titled “a pro-innovation approach to AI regulation”, (the Whitepaper) which sets out the UK’s proposed regulatory framework for AI.
    * The principles are as follows:
        * Safety, security and robustness. AI should function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout its lifecycle and risks should be continually identified, assessed and managed.
        * Appropriate transparency and explainability. AI should be appropriately transparent and explainable, i.e., it should provide information on how, when and for what purposes AI is being used, while also making it possible for parties to access, interpret and understand its decision-making processes.
        * Fairness. AI should not undermine the legal rights of individuals or organisations, discriminate unfairly against individuals or create unfair market outcomes.
        * Accountability and governance. Governance measures should be in place to ensure effective oversight of the supply and use of AI, with clear lines of accountability established across the AI life cycle.
        * Contestability and redress. Impacted third parties or users of AI should be able to contest an AI decision or outcome that is harmful or creates material risk of harm.

    * A professional journalist, I had recently applied for a new job, and for the first part of the recruitment process the publisher made me play a number of simple online games from the comfort of my own home. These included having to quickly count the number of dots in two boxes, inflating a balloon before it burst to win money, and matching emotions to facial expressions. 
    * Then an artificial intelligence (AI) software system assessed my personality, and either passed or failed me. No human had a look-in.

We show that performance similar to GPT-3 can be obtained with language models that are much “greener” in that their parameter count is several orders of magnitude smaller. This is achieved by converting textual inputs into cloze questions that contain a task description, combined with gradient-based optimization; exploiting unlabeled data gives further improvements. ...
