    * Introducing QOI — the Quite OK Image format. 
    * It losslessly compresses RGB and RGBA images to a similar size of PNG, while offering a 20x-50x speedup in compression and 3x-4x speedup in decompression. All single-threaded, no SIMD. It's also stupidly simple.
    * tl;dr: 300 lines of C, single header, 
    * Somewhere between RLE and LZW
