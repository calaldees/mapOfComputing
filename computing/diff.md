    * Unified Diffs have not kept up with where the world is going. For instance:
        * A single diff can’t represent a list of commits
        * There’s no standard way to represent binary patches
        * Diffs don’t know about text encodings (which is more of a problem than you might think)
        * Diffs don’t have any standard format for arbitrary metadata, so everyone implements it their own way.
