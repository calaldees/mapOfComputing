    * How Much Power Does a Data Center Use?
        * The largest data center market in the world is in Northern Virginia in the United States and it has a 2,552 megawatt capacity.
        * 1MW = 1 million watts. For context, one megawatt is enough energy to power about 200 American homes.
        * In 2023, data centers consumed 7.4 gigawatts of power. (1GW = 1 billion watts.)
        * That’s approximately 1–1.3% of total power in the world. Expand that to all IT energy demand, and that number is about 10% of global energy consumption.
