> It's always DNS
Kind of meme joke, but with big systems, it often is.
Global: one
> We're making too many DNS requests in the stack, while our DNS servers are fine, it looks like we're taxing the AWS DNS resolvers in our VPC.  Because of how the DNS resolve.conf is setup in our pods, we end up searching based on domain search paths making 5 DNS requests per resolution.  This change reduces the load in 2 ways:
> Fully qualified xxx endpoint: The full qualified endpoint is greater than the number of dots ndots so this turns off DNS searching.Reduces the number of dots that will be used in DNS 'searching', xxx.xxx has one dot so will result in DNS searching, but www.google.com has 2 dots so will be treated as a fully qualified domain and not search.
```yaml
xxx_ENDPOINT: http://xxx.xxx.svc.cluster.local
```
```yaml
      dnsConfig:
        options:
          - name: ndots
            value: "1"
```

Both of these changes combine to only have a single request per DNS resolve.

    * This is interesting because logging is normally done my monitoring TCP - most security firewalls let DNS traffic through
