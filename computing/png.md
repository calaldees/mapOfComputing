    * A complete implementation of PNG1.0 spec in a few lines of code. Breaks down headers

        * It's "Good enough" at lossless image compression.
        * It builds on existing technologies (zlib/DEFLATE compression).
        * It's simple to implement (helped by the above point).
        * It supports a variety of modes and bit-depths, including "true color" (24-bit RGB) and transparency.
        * It isn't patented.
