Computer Science
================

What is it?
Not a single language

* [Theoretical Computer Science Cheat Sheet](https://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf)

Computer Science is a subset of the discipline of Computing

* [[theory]]

* [The only computer science book worth reading twice?](https://simondobson.org/2010/05/14/cs-book-worth-reading-twice/)
    * Structure and interpretation of computer programs by Hal Abelson and Jerry Sussman (MIT Press. 1984. ISBN 0-262-01077-1), also known as SICP
        * lambda-abstraction and higher-order computation
        * complex data structures, including structures with embedded computational content
        * modularity and mutability
        * streams
        * lazy evaluation
        * interpreter and compiler construction
        * storage management, garbage collection and virtual memory
        * machine code
        * domain-specific languages
    * All in `scheme`!
    * Amazing to have a book that spans all the layers of abstraction beyond the primitive procedural languages at the time.



* [EWD 1041](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1041.html) prof. dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra 1989
    * CS Education sucks
    * > CS faculty members from all over the world, and the vast majority of them —I mean about 95 % of them— cannot program a Binary Search. It is a very shocking percentage, but you can take my word for it.
    * Managers think programming is lowest common denominator and faults happen - Dijkstra argues for thinking about the problem and solving it properly
    * The rigor of CS is not understood by the world
