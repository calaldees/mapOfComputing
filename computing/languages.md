    * Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.

    * Logical (example in Prolog)
        * Describe _what_ not _how_
        * Variables/Constants, Facts, Rules (specify relationships between facts)

        * programs can run backwards and forwards finding missing value
    * Procedural (example in Assembler)
        * two register A and D
        * no multiplication, devision
        * constants go to A

Static languages
----------------

* [Typing is Hard](https://3fx.ch/typing-is-hard.html)
    * Static typing description in a variety of languages


Systems level languages
-----------------------

* [The case for a modern language (part 1)](https://jeang3nie.codeberg.page/case-for-modern-language-pt1/)
    * C is less than perfect
    * > as with many things #BSD even when thay do something that is obviously better than Linux it just never really gets adopted there
    * > the fact that `libc` looks and feels very much like it was hacked together by a bunch of random dudes over the course of a few decades rather than being designed. Which is, of course, exactly what happened. 
    * > I have some other complaints about C that revolve around the lack of any kind of official error handling strategy, the issue of null in general, etc 
    * > but what it really comes down to is that if we keep the language we should at the very least modernize `libc` and standardize the other tooling around the language somewhat.

* C
* Rust
* Nim
* Zig



Learn Online
------------

* [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
    * JavaScript challenges in browser
    * (other langauges with multiple choice and videos)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

    * JS in browser



Other Languages
===============

* [On repl-driven programming](http://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/)
    * Common Lisp and Smalltalk are repl languages
        * Other languages have something similar
    * repl: read-eval-print loop

Other Language Domains
----------------------

* [Catala: A Programming Language for the Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03198)
* 

smalltalk
---------
Live coding in browser (?)
* [caffeine.js.org](https://caffeine.js.org/)
    * > Caffeine is a livecoding environment for web browsers, Node.js, and WebAssembly. After adding it to a webpage, you can use it to make live persistent changes to that page and other pages running Caffeine, without reloading.



Esoteric
--------

* [A Brief Introduction to Esoteric Languages](https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/esolangs/)
    * Brainfuck (turing complete - obtuse)
    * Piet (executable image)
* [orca](http://100r.co/site/orca.html)
    * designed to create procedural sequencers in which each letter of the alphabet is an operation, where lowercase letters operate on bang, uppercase letters operate each frame.
    * The application is not a synthesiser, but a flexible livecoding environment capable of sending MIDI, OSC & UDP to your audio interface, like Ableton, Renoise, VCV Rack or SuperCollider.
* [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/help/jforc/loopless_code_i_verbs_have_r.htm)
    * Loopless code

Number systems
--------------

Python has "abstract" number system

Java, Golang, C are all based on x86
Overflow
Modulo operator does not support negative

Javascript (which should be abstract, but was heavily designed in an era of systems performance requirements) uses x86 modulo operator (which does not work with negative numbers)


Performance
------------

* [Modern Python performance considerations](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/893686/8978976335696804/) [[performance-profileing]] [[dynamic-programming]] [[python]]
    * Why is python slow?
