    * Crazy detail
    * > Triple decoder is one unique effect. The fact that Intel managed to get them lined up for small loops to do 9x effective instruction issue is basically miraculous IMO. Very well done.
      > Another unique effect is L2 shared between 4 cores. This means that thread communications across those 4 cores has much lower latencies.

Microcode
---------

Software on the processor to perform common operations efficiently. In modern processors this can be updated with a firmware update

    * > The Intel 8086 processor was introduced in 1978, ancestor of the x86 architecture. The 8086 was the first microprocessor with prefetch, reading instructions from memory in advance for more speed. By reverse-engineering the chip under a microscope, I can explain how this works.
