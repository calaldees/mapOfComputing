I was looking at case studies for [[telematry]] and was thinking of practical uses

* [Dev Concepts](https://dev-concepts.dev/) Book (pre-order)


* [Engineering productivity can be measured - just not how you'd expect ](https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured) Antoine Boulanger 2021
    * AMAZING article
    * Mistake 1 - measure approximations of output
        * Developers game the system - seniors get board of the games
    * Mistake 2 - Measure nothing as its too complex
        * Long term motivation suffers as nothing matters
        * This system rewards charisma
    * The Solution: Measure Blockers at the Team Level 
        * Blockers
            * Quality of developer tools
            * Frequency and quality of internal activities (like meetings or code reviews)
            * Focused maker time (free from disruptive meetings)
            * Easy access to documentation
            * Psychological safety on the team
            * Work-life balance
            * Presence of other high-performers
            * A fair system of rewards
        * Metrics
            * How much free, uninterrupted time does an engineer have to code?
            * How long is an engineer waiting on a response from another engineer's review?
            * How often do dev tools get in the way instead of helping accelerate work? 
            * How often are engineers required to context switch, preventing deep work?
            * How often do engineers receive pages outside of business hours, interrupting their sleep or family life?
        * An engineering leader exists to enable their team to achieve their goals
* [The SPACE of Developer Productivity](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) - There's more to it than you think.
    * Measuring productivity in multi dimenisons
    * SPACE (5 dimensions)
        * satisfaction and well-being; 
        * performance; 
        * activity; 
        * communication and collaboration; 
        * and efficiency and flow. 
* [How to hire senior developers: Give them more autonomy](https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/autonomy/)
    * (insightful article about the value of code and the value of developers) - code is the manifestation of the the understanding of a problem
    * Your source code is worthless
    * The main value of a software company is the mapping of source code and problem space in the developer’s heads
    * developers should be given more responsibility and regarded as permanent assets to the company.
    * If you’re in a management position, you need to realize that development is mainly decision making, which of course only works if you’re given the necessary autonomy to make those decisions.

* [What I’ve Learned in 45 Years in the Software Industry](https://www.bti360.com/what-ive-learned-in-45-years-in-the-software-industry/)

* [What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/)
    * > "SV-like" companies think of engineers as value generators, and creative problem solvers. Traditional companies think of them as factory workers.
    1. Autonomy for software engineers
        * > The expectation from developers at traditional companies is to complete assigned work. At SV-like companies, it's to solve problems that the business has.
    2. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources
        * > In practice, a motivated engineer easily makes multiple times the impact of a "factory worker" who is just told what to do
    3. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency
    4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics
        * > In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business
    5. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangle-communication
        * > Traditional companies will encourage hierarchical communication
    6. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience
        * > While it might sound counter-intuitive to hire software engineers who only focus on other software engineers working faster: at many places, it's not. It's a great return that helps these companies move faster, and developers stay happier.
    7. Higher leverage --> higher {autonomy, pay}

* [Software development topics I've changed my mind on after 6 years in the industry](https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-6-years)
    * Bad code can be written in any paradigm
    * Clever code isn't usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns
    * Despite being called "engineers," most decision are pure cargo-cult with no backing analysis, data, or numbers
    * Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality

* [Maximizing Developer Effectiveness](https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html) Martin Fowler 2021
    * Technology is constantly becoming smarter and more powerful. I often observe that as these technologies are introduced an organization’s productivity instead of improving has reduced. This is because the technology has increased complexities and cognitive overhead to the developer, reducing their effectiveness.

    * Code is just data - when we make decisions about code, it's kind of data-science
    * We should never make decisions without knowing the
