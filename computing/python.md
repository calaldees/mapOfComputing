Professional Interview Screening

what is PEP8 -> style guide
what is a decorator -> function wrapper
what is the difference between list & tuple -> mutability

```python
    >>> aa=(x+1 for x in range(3)) ; print(tuple(aa), tuple(aa))
    ((1, 2, 3), ())
    # Q: Why? - A: The generator is exhausted

    >>> aa=[1,2,3] ; bb=aa ; aa[:]=[4,5,6] ; print(aa, bb)
    ([4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6])
    # Q: Why? - A: aa an bb reference the same list

    >>> dd = {i for i in (1,2,2,3)} ; dd &= {2,3,4} ; print(dd)
    set([2, 3])
    # Q: Why? - A: sets have no duplicates `&=` is union_in-place modification
```

I asked ChatGPT on 24/04/2023 these interview screening questions

I have a set of questions I use to screen professional python programmers before inviting them to a job interview.
I have listed three mini programs and their output. I ask candidates to describe why each program creates these outputs.
Can you explain why these python snippets produce the outputs they do?

    >>> aa=(x+1 for x in range(3)) ; print(tuple(aa), tuple(aa))
    ((1, 2, 3), ())

    >>> aa=[1,2,3] ; bb=aa ; aa[:]=[4,5,6] ; print(aa, bb)
    ([4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6])

    >>> dd = {i for i in (1,2,2,3)} ; dd &= {2,3,4} ; print(dd)
    set([2, 3])

Sure, I'd be happy to explain these snippets!

1. `aa=(x+1 for x in range(3)) ; print(tuple(aa), tuple(aa))`

In this code, a generator expression is created with `(x+1 for x in range(3))` and assigned to the variable `aa`. A generator is a special type of iterable that allows you to iterate over its elements one at a time. 

Then, `tuple(aa)` is called twice: the first time, it creates a tuple with the first three values of the generator (1, 2, 3) and prints it. The second time, `tuple(aa)` creates an empty tuple because all the values in the generator have already been exhausted by the previous `tuple(aa)` call. 

So the output of this program is `((1, 2, 3), ())`.

2. `aa=[1,2,3] ; bb=aa ; aa[:]=[4,5,6] ; print(aa, bb)`

This code creates a list `aa` containing the values 1, 2, and 3, and then assigns `aa` to the variable `bb`. The third line is where the interesting stuff happens: `aa[:]=[4,5,6]`. This is a slice assignment, which means it replaces the entire contents of `aa` with the new list `[4,5,6]`. Since `bb` is just a reference to the same list object as `aa`, it also gets updated with the new values.

So the output of this program is `([4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6])`.

3. `dd = {i for i in (1,2,2,3)} ; dd &= {2,3,4} ; print(dd)`

In this code, a set comprehension is used to create a new set `dd` containing the unique values from the tuple `(1,2,2,3)`. Since sets can only contain unique values, this set contains the values 1, 2, and 3. 

Then, `dd &= {2,3,4}` performs an in-place intersection of `dd` with the set `{2,3,4}`. This means that any elements in `dd` that are not also in `{2,3,4}` are removed, leaving only the values 2 and 3.

So the output of this program is `set([2, 3])`.

    # aa=[1,2,3];bb=aa;aa=[4,5,6];print(aa,bb)

    t = 10 + 1, 20 + 2 ; assert t == 11, 22

### Type checking in python

    * msgspec is a fast serialization and validation library, with builtin support for JSON, MessagePack, YAML, and TOML. It features:
    * üöÄ High performance encoders/decoders for common protocols. The JSON and MessagePack implementations regularly benchmark as the fastest options for Python.
    * üéâ Support for a wide variety of Python types. Additional types may be supported through extensions.
    * üîç Zero-cost schema validation using familiar Python type annotations. In benchmarks msgspec decodes and validates JSON faster than orjson can decode it alone.
    * ‚ú® A speedy Struct type for representing structured data. If you already use dataclasses or attrs, Structs should feel familiar. However, they‚Äôre 5-60x faster for common operations.
