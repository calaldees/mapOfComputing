    * > NTFS VULNERABILITY CRITICALITY UNDERESTIMATED
      > There is a specially nasty vulnerability in NTFS right now.
      > Triggerable by opening special crafted name in any folder anywhere.'
      > The vulnerability will instant pop up complaining about yuor harddrive is corrupted when path is opened
    * > The vulnerability can be remotely triggered if having any kind of service allowing file opens of specific names to happen.
      > Its embeddable in HTML, sharred folders etc. 
      >Until now only consequence have been running chkdsk on boot- but now the MFT have corrupted
    * > Its triggerable as a low privileged user- no special credentials or write permissions are needed.
    * > All that appears to be happening from this is that the volume dirty bits get flipped in the $Volume file.  Until those bits are reset, Windows will see the volume as corrupted.  The file system is not actually corrupted by .\:$i30:$bitmap.
    * > Seems like it can also be triggered when you paste the command in the URL of a browser except ie so far

didnt know where else to put this ...
