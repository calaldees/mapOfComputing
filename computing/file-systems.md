File Systems
============

FAT(16) - file allocation table
FAT32
NTFS
EXT4
* [[zfs]]

* [Understanding Googleâ€™s File System](https://www.micahlerner.com/2020/03/22/understanding-googles-file-system.html) 2020
  * 64mb chunks in cloud

* [Projected File System](https://scorpiosoftware.net/2024/02/20/projected-file-system/)
  * Linux already exposes most devices as part of the file system
  * In Windows 10+ it is possible to make application data visible as files
    * C++ headers and examples

Parity

    * > NTFS VULNERABILITY CRITICALITY UNDERESTIMATED
      > There is a specially nasty vulnerability in NTFS right now.
      > Triggerable by opening special crafted name in any folder anywhere.'
      > The vulnerability will instant pop up complaining about yuor harddrive is corrupted when path is opened
    * > The vulnerability can be remotely triggered if having any kind of service allowing file opens of specific names to happen.
      > Its embeddable in HTML, sharred folders etc. 
      >Until now only consequence have been running chkdsk on boot- but now the MFT have corrupted
    * > Its triggerable as a low privileged user- no special credentials or write permissions are needed.
    * > All that appears to be happening from this is that the volume dirty bits get flipped in the $Volume file.  Until those bits are reset, Windows will see the volume as corrupted.  The file system is not actually corrupted by .\:$i30:$bitmap.
    * > Seems like it can also be triggered when you paste the command in the URL of a browser except ie so far

didnt know where else to put this ...
* [tabfs](https://omar.website/tabfs/)
    * browser tabs (bi directional) as a filesystem mount
* [juicefs](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs)
    * A distributed POSIX file system built on top of Redis and S3


* [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync)
  * Sort of can be used like the copy command, but only copies the changed bits
  * [[networks]]
  * [[terminal]]
  * New
    * [Bit-Sync](https://github.com/claytongulick/bit-sync) - pure javascript rsync protocol to sync arbitrary binary data
    * [zsync](http://zsync.moria.org.uk/) - rsync via [[http]]
      * zsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file from a remote server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as rsync
      * have a `.zsync` file with precalculated hash's


* [FSSPEC: Filesystem interfaces for Python](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) #python
  * abstraction layer for file access

Proxy
-----

Translate from one file system to another in realtime (mounting)

* [[fuse]]
* [WinFSP - Windows File System Proxy - FUSE for Windows ](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp)


Novel Use
---------

* linux - devices are on the filesystem
* [ffs: the file fileystem](https://mgree.github.io/ffs/)
  * mount semi-structured data (like JSON) as a Unix filesystem
