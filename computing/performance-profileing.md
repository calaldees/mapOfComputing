Performance Profiling
=====================

* [Flame Graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html)
    * > Flame graphs are a visualization of hierarchical data, created to visualize stack traces of profiled software so that the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately.
    * [pyspy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-run-py-spy-in-docker)
    * https://roman.pt/posts/python-performance-profiling/
    * Pyspy live https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8s2fzqA07s

* Instrumentation
    * TODO define

* [Tracy Profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy)
    * > A real time, nanosecond resolution, remote telemetry, hybrid frame and sampling profiler for games and other applications.

    * Aewsome animated gifs and real examples

* [Counting cycles and instructions on the Apple M1 processor](https://lemire.me/blog/2021/03/24/counting-cycles-and-instructions-on-the-apple-m1-processor/)
    * How do you measure performance?
        * modern process's just overclock to run faster
        * [[branch-prediction]] takes power
    * What is you wanted to measure page useaage?

* [FunctionTrace](https://functiontrace.com/) - A graphical Python profiler that provides a clear view of your application's execution while being both low-overhead and easy to use.

Real data vs theoretical best/worst cast

Data throughput, response times.

    * Python profiler that outputs in a format that can be loaded by chrome dev tools for visulisations
* [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html)

    * human abstraction for curl and some performance graphs
