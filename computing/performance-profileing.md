Performance Profiling
=====================

* Instrumentation
    * TODO define

* [Counting cycles and instructions on the Apple M1 processor](https://lemire.me/blog/2021/03/24/counting-cycles-and-instructions-on-the-apple-m1-processor/)
    * How do you measure performance?
        * modern process's just overclock to run faster
        * [[branch-prediction]] takes power
    * What is you wanted to measure page useaage?

* [FunctionTrace](https://functiontrace.com/) - A graphical Python profiler that provides a clear view of your application's execution while being both low-overhead and easy to use.

Real data vs theoretical best/worst cast

Data throughput, response times.

* [GFXBench](https://gfxbench.com/result.jsp)

* [shish/eventtracer-py](https://github.com/shish/eventtracer-py)
    * Python profiler that outputs in a format that can be loaded by chrome dev tools for visulisations
* [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html)
