    * Fearlessness is undervalued
    * You can’t predict the future; try and you might end up in trouble
    * Nothing really matters, except bringing value to the customer
    * Perfection is unachievable
    * If you can’t connect it to the business, it doesn’t matter
    * Write tests that give you confidence that the system works as it should
        * 'how' is largely irrelevent
    * Using other people’s code is not as good as I thought
    * Some companies get it, others don’t. But nobody’s perfect
    * Investing in feedback loops is never wasted effort
    * Always leave something unfinished at the end of the day
    * Sharpen the axe
        * improve your daily tools
    * Hiring is hard
    * The most important trait in developers: rolling up their sleeves because it has to get done
    * Work on a codebase with other people over a longer period of time
        * see how decisions pan out
        * how extendable is your code
    * Knowing the full stack
    * Typing can be the bottleneck
    * Code reviews aren’t waterproof
    * Not every code review is worth the effort
    * Negativity begets negativity
    * Every dial at 100% all the time doesn’t work
    * Code has mass
    * Programming as a part of my life
        * You have to program/interest outside work

* [The Developer Advocate's Guide to Getting Buy-In](https://dev.to/theworstdev/the-developer-advocates-guide-to-getting-buy-in-1ba4)
    * You present an idea, everyone agrees, but nobody commits and work never happens
    * > Buy-in is an agreement to support a decision. So, when we are trying to get buy-in, we're trying to get decision-makers to support our ideas. So, the act of getting buy-in is a process that involves building trust, communicating your ideas well, and hopefully creating champions so that when you ask for a commitment, you already have the right people on board.


* [A Human-Centered Approach to Developer Productivity](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9994260)
    * Humans are messy
    * It's impossible to separate technical problems from human problems
    * A thoughtful birds eye view of software made by humans
