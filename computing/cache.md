        Modified (M)
            This data has been modified, and differs from main memory
            This data is the source-of-truth, and all other data elsewhere is stale
        Exclusive (E)
            This data has not been modified, and is in sync with the data in main memory
            No other sibling cache has this data
        Shared (S)
            This data has not been modified, and is in sync with the data elsewhere
            There are other sibling caches that (may) also have this same data
        Invalid (I)
            This data is stale, and should never ever be used
