============

* [The semantic future of the web](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/10/the-semantic-future-of-the-web/)
    * Much of the data currently exchanging hands can be viewed as human-centric ... We are not the only consumers of the web though, with search engines, voice assistants, pricing bots, and even link preview bots 
    * Open Graph, Microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD.
    * This data is part of the Facebook ecosystem; it effectively “belongs” to them. In a future where data is in our own control, sites like Facebook could just be the visual representation of the existing network, built on a Semantic Web
    * If you asked, “all songs before 1995 that failed domestically but were well-received worldwide,” you would be unlikely to get results because no one has yet answered that question. The data for such a query exists on the web; however, it is not readily available due to how search works.

    * People are lazy and lie
    * schemas are not neutral

    * A joint effort made by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex
