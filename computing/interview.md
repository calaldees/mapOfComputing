5min story background. Who are you, how did you get here

Clarify any assumptions you made subconsciously. Many questions are under-specified on purpose. E.g. a tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work.

How would you test a random number generator

you type `google.com` into a urlbar
You have as much time as you like to describe all the facets of computing that now happens

As an interviewee 
* Explain your reasoning
* Know different methods for solving a problem
* Ask for clarification, if needed
* Elaborate on answers you don't know

* Behavioural interview questions
    * respond with - Situation, Task, Action and Result
* Situational interview questions
* Education interview questions
    * What do you do to stay up-to-date on your technical certifications and knowledge?
* Technical questions
    * [When and How You Should Denormalize a Relational Database](https://rubygarage.org/blog/database-denormalization-with-examples)
    * In micro-service architecture, what are the ways in which services can be interconnected
    * What is the role of continuous integration systems in the automated-build process?
    * Why would you squash a feature branch before when merging upstream?

    https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

    You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

    Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
    
    Example 1:
    >>> maxProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])
    5

    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

    Example 2:
    >>> maxProfit([7,6,4,3,1])
    0

    Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
