* [Why Static Languages Suffer From Complexity](https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity.html)
    * Amazing description of dynamic abstractions and actual static implementations and why there is always coupling between both "biformity"

    * > Your language is a user interface, and an API which people use to interface with machines. The smaller the API surface, the less you risk introducing accidental complexity and subtle design mistakes.
    * > Limiting yourself to a smaller feature set likely means you will want to choose features that donâ€™t overlap and that provide the most expressiveness, the most value to programmers. If you do want to grow your language, do it slowly.

    * compiled vs interpreted
    * static vs dynamic
    * strict vs lazy
    * pure vs side-effects

* [We need to talk about parentheses](https://andreyor.st/posts/2020-12-03-we-need-to-talk-about-parentheses/)
    * Why LISP has so many brackets. Some good arguments about scope. But parenthesis are difficult are difficult for humans to count.
