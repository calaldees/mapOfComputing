    * > Your language is a user interface, and an API which people use to interface with machines. The smaller the API surface, the less you risk introducing accidental complexity and subtle design mistakes.
    * > Limiting yourself to a smaller feature set likely means you will want to choose features that donâ€™t overlap and that provide the most expressiveness, the most value to programmers. If you do want to grow your language, do it slowly.
