        * Again, true interactive development is programming such that
            * your program never crashes
            * because it enters an interactive debugger
            * where you never lose program state
            * unless you choose to do so
            * after a thorough inspection of state
            * including the call stack
            * and after you have tinkered, recompiled functions, and edited objects
            * and after you have tried restarting the computation
            * all while the live program is running, possibly remotely. 
        * Creators need immediate connection to what they are creating.
