* [DAW Frontend Development Struggles](https://billydm.github.io/blog/daw-frontend-development-struggles/)
    * DAW GUIs are complicated - animated and always redrawing - we want to save CPU for audio processing

* [Radium - The Music Editor](http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/)
    * interesting [[GUI]] design
    * > Compared to the piano roll interface, editing is quicker and more musical data fits on the screen. (Radium has a piano roll as well.)
    * > Compared to the tracker interface, note positions and effects can be edited graphically. Graphical editing provides more vertical space and gives a better visualization of musical data. (Everything can also be edited by text, like in a normal tracker, combining the best of two worlds.)
