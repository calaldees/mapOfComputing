======================

* [[maths]]

* Special values
    * Epsilon
    * NaN
    * `+` infinity
    * `-` infinity
    * max
    * min

    * It consists of three loosely connected parts. 
        1. Rounding Error, 
            * discusses the implications of using different rounding strategies for the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
            * background information on the two methods of measuring rounding error, ulps and relative error
        2. the IEEE floating-point standard, which is becoming rapidly accepted by commercial hardware manufacturers.
        3. connections between floating-point and the design of various aspects of computer systems. 
            * instruction set design, optimizing compilers and exception handling.
