    * 1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.
    * covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of bad code

* Types of Errors
    * Syntax Errors
        * Wrong words
        * reserved words
        * order
        * too many, too few params
    * Logic Errors
    * Runtime Errors
        * User input outside expected ranges
        * Runs out of memory or other resources
        * Permissions issues

* Types of testing
    * Static
        * compilation
    * Dynamic
        * programs executed and checked
    * Passive/Explorative
        * Humans explore functionality
* Black box / white box
* Manual / Automated
* Good Unit tests
    * isolation (should not affect other tests) - always return same result
    * Short - are they understandable to read?
    * application requirements - relevant to future
    * small surface area - failure should help identity source of error
    * fast
* It is skilled/hard to write good tests
    * Arrange (setup your state/variables/env)
    * Act (perform the operation)
    * Assert (check the output)
