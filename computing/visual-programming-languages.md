    * > I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. 
      > The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes.

Its distinguishing feature is that the program is expressed solely with pictures and their layouts. No letters are necessary at all. Therefore, Viscuit is perfectly suitable for pre-school children.
