    * Great description of conventional code editing is "caveman in a dark cave with a tourch" analogy
    * great eye tracking gif of reading code (not linear)
    * > But there is no truly mainstream general purpose Visual Programming Language at the moment. By every single metric, modern programming languages landscape is 100% dominated by textual programming languages with zero exceptions.
    * [Programming_language_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory)
    * > Vision, for example, mostly deals with spatial information - you have to get all input “at once” – you can’t see the image looking it one pixel at a time
    * > Hearing, on the other hand, works predominantly with temporal patterns - you can’t listen to a melody by listening all notes together at the same time.
    * > And that is exactly where both visual and textual representations of code are often missing the point. They attempt to express both, spatial and temporal, components in a similar fashion, and it just adds a cognitive load and doesn’t help at all.
    * > Encoding spatial component visually makes absolutely perfect sense – it’s the most natural way to encode it, 
      > but the temporal component is still better expressed with text - not perfect, but a still unbeatable

    * > I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. 
      > The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.

Its distinguishing feature is that the program is expressed solely with pictures and their layouts. No letters are necessary at all. Therefore, Viscuit is perfectly suitable for pre-school children.
