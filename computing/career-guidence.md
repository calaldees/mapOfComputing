* [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1339777933871865857) advocates learning tools
    * I get asked for career advice a lot, and while my "learn deeply" pitch may be good long term advice, it doesn't help breaking in -- being able to write your own tool chain with a hex editor is great and all, but it doesn't add value at most companies.
    * I suspect there is a useful path that I think of as the "tool master". 
    * Modern art and programming tools are enormously complex systems, and the typical user only touches a tiny fraction of their features. Picking a path of study that revolves around deeply learning a tool rather than building works is potentially backwards, but if you learn why every feature exists, you actually learn a lot about the craft the tool is used for, and you are very likely to be able to add value to a team almost immediately by teaching tricks to the existing developers, or at least hit the ground running if you were selected for tool compatibility.
    * The "Unix guru" is a tool master, and so is the "language lawyer". Presumable Photoshop and Maya have similar roles. It would be critical for someone following this path to not become opinionated, because they don't have the broader experience to justify it, but as a store of knowledge and skills it seems a useful distinguishing mark at an entry level for those inclined that way.
    * This is a random thought at this point, does anyone involved in hiring want to comment?

Personal Projects
-----------------

(Build stuff!)[https://why.degree/motivation/] - Personal Project

* Side projects are important in landing your early jobs
* [Advice to my young self: to succeed in your career, forget side projects and focus on your job](https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/focus-on-jour-job/)
    * You spend 7 hours a work day using the tech - only a few hours on home tech
    * To many side projects are off-putting to employers
