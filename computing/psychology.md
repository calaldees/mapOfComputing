        * > The Facebook study wasn't controversial because of what it showed. It was controversial because Facebook didn't even do a minimum of ethical approval. Participants did not consent to a study (at least not knowingly). So while it was legal (because the law doesn't care about whether you are aware of what you agree to) it was definitely not ethical. TL;DR: The FB study would have had the researcher kicked out of any accredited school anywhere for ethical violations.

    * [Healthy Tech Myths](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Healthy-Tech-Myths-DataSociety-20201007.pdf)
        * Myth 1: Social media  is addictive,  and we are powerless to  resist it
            * > The panic often stems from desires to protect and control others, particularly women  and children, who are seen as uniquely vulnerable to its harmful properties
            > Moral panics often use the language  of addiction to pathologize the thing they fear. 
            > This myth reinforces the narrative that technology design leads to control of millions of users, locating enormous power with a small group  of tech companies
            * "differential  susceptibility" each individual is more/or-less susceptible - this has been the same throughout history
        * Myth 2: Technology  companies can fix the problems they create with better technology.
            * > Technological solutions to social problems seem quicker, cheaper, and simpler to implement than larger  social changes.
        * Myth 3: Growth and  engagement  metrics are  the best drivers  of decision- making at tech companies
            * > What you can measure becomes what you value: it’s easier to measure growth than health and well-being
            * > Many of our most cherished values are not amenable to quantitative measurement
        * Myth 4: Our health and well-being depend on spending less time with screens and social media platforms
            * > “attention extraction economy” is why individuals are unhappy, and why societies are failing.
            * > Health and well-being cannot be reduced to the single variable of screen time.
