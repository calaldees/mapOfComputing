* [Virtual Workshop - Vectorization](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/vector/default)
    *  Vectorization is a process by which floating-point computations in scientific code are compiled into special instructions that execute elementary operations (+,-,*, etc.) or functions (exp, cos, etc.) in parallel on fixed-size vector arrays. The ultimate goal of vectorization is an increase in floating-point performance (possibly integer and logical performance as well) through hardware parallelism.
