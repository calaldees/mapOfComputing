Hacking and Security
====================

* [9Sec Blog](https://9esec.io/blog) - Experts insights

* 75% of all attacks are phishing
* Social engineering
* Malware
    * virus
    * trogan
* Randomware
* Spyware/adware
* Hacking DDoS

* fake phishing emails - get data on links/replys - levels of difficulty
* Vishing (voice call phishing)
    * never take unsolicited calls
* multi factor authentication
* passowrd managers (dont use the same password)

* [pam-duress](https://github.com/nuvious/pam-duress)
    * > A Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) which allows the establishment of alternate passwords that can be used to perform actions to clear sensitive data, notify IT/Security staff, close off sensitive network connections, etc if a user is coerced into giving a threat actor a password

You can't add it later

Question: how will you know you've had a data breach?

Users are evil and dumb
Could be hijacked
People are horrible

        * > The first details on the “Sunburst” attack were released in December 2020: a highly evasive attacker leveraged the supply chain of the U.S. based software company SolarWinds in order to compromise an administrative I.T. management tool which is used by tens of thousands of private and government organizations. The backdoors and malware that were installed on the victims’ infrastructures have been called by Microsoft “the most sophisticated and protracted intrusion attacks of the decade”.
        * > The attack on SolarWinds has made it more apparent than ever before that software supply chain attacks are incredibly destructive. Damage done in a tiny module delivered by a small software vendor can break a global software empire’s security.

        * > Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: They can convey information about the software running on the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive information about security-related computations.
        * > The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption ... using a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 10 meters away.
