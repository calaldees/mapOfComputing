TCP
===

* see [[mptcp]]
    * TCP-in-UDP

* [Let's code a TCP/IP stack, 1: Ethernet & ARP](https://www.saminiir.com/lets-code-tcp-ip-stack-1-ethernet-arp/)

* [Comparing TCP and QUIC](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2022-11/quicvtcp.html)
* [MicroTCP](https://github.com/cozis/microtcp)  A minimal TCP/IP stack 
    * > MicroTCP is a TCP/IP network stack I started building as a learning exercise while attending the Computer Networking course
    * > MicroTCP implements ARP (RFC 826, complete), IPv4 (no fragmentation), ICMP (minimum necessary to reply to pings) and TCP (complete but not stress-tested)


* also in [[optimisations]]
* [Why your website should be under 14kB in size](https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/)
    * 14kb is 10 TCP packets, no need for acks, [[tcp]] slow start. MTU size of 1500bytes (ethernet layer2 limitation)
