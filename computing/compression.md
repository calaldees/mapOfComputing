* [Modern LZ Compression ](https://glinscott.github.io/lz/index.html) - Gary Linscott 2021
    * walks through the components of a modern LZ compressor
    * create a compressor that can beat gzip while decompressing at almost the same speed — in less than 1000 lines
    * (beautiful single page layout with code)

New techniques
--------------
* [vectorly](https://vectorly.io/) Vector video on the web (startup beta) - this is a HARD problem - I don't know how far they will get

Algorithms

Licencing
---------

* [An Invisible Tax on the Web: Video Codecs](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/07/11/royalty-free-web-video-codecs/)
    * H264 and H265 are patented codecs - playing video is not free
    * AV1 is open source

Image Compression
-----------------

* [[jpeg]]

* [Lossless Image Compression in O(n) Time](https://phoboslab.org/log/2021/11/qoi-fast-lossless-image-compression)
    * Introducing QOI — the Quite OK Image format. 
    * It losslessly compresses RGB and RGBA images to a similar size of PNG, while offering a 20x-50x speedup in compression and 3x-4x speedup in decompression. All single-threaded, no SIMD. It's also stupidly simple.
    * tl;dr: 300 lines of C, single header, 
    * Somewhere between RLE and LZW
