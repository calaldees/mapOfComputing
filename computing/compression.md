* [Modern LZ Compression](https://glinscott.github.io/lz/index.html) - Gary Linscott 2021
    * walks through the components of a modern LZ compressor
    * create a compressor that can beat gzip while decompressing at almost the same speed â€” in less than 1000 lines

* [lizard LZ5](https://github.com/inikep/lizard)
    * > Lizard (formerly LZ5) is an efficient compressor with very fast decompression. It achieves compression ratio that is comparable to zip/zlib and zstd/brotli (at low and medium compression levels) at decompression speed of 1000 MB/s and faster. 
* [Dissecting the GZIP format](https://www.infinitepartitions.com/art001.html)
    * The DEFLATE algorithm uses a combination of LZ77, Huffman codes and run-length-encoding;
