    * Big O
    * Sorting algorithums
    * Bubblesort, InertionSort, Quicksort
    * Worst case n^2
    * Bogosort (randomise it every time and check sorted)
    * Think about what works best for the problem you are trying to solve .. that might be a text file [[software-engineering-skills]]

    * The following animations illustrate how effectively data sets from different starting points can be sorted using different algorithms
