    * Bogosort (randomise it every time and check sorted)

Joke Sorting Algorithms
-----------------------

* [Is this the simplest (and most surprising) sorting algorithm ever?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01111)
    * Algorithm 1 ICan’tBelieveItCanSort(A[1..n])
    * ```
        for i = 1 to n do
        for j = 1 to n do
        if A[i] < A[j] then
        swap A[i] and A[j]
        ```
    * > There is nothing good about this algorithm. It is slow – the algorithm obviously runs in Θ(n2) time, whether worst-case, average-case or best-case.
      > It unnecessarily compares all pairs of positions, twice (but see Section 3).
      > There seems to be no intuition behind it, and its correctness is not entirely obvious. You certainly do not want to use it as a first example to introduce students to sorting algorithms.


### Time Sort

Each item - sleep for n seconds - n is value - when process wakes up, add to list
This is crap - but runs in O(n) complexity - and is racy and inefficent - what does that tell us about O(n) measure?
