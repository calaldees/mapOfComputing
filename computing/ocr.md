Optical Character Recondition
2025 - kind of a dead branch of computing - replaced with VisualLanguageModels

* [Back to the Future of Hand Writing Recognition](https://jackschaedler.github.io/handwriting-recognition/)
    * Beautiful interactive web example of smoothing and corner detection

    * OCR technologies are being replaced by AI vision technologies

        * The problem with doing OCR with LLMs is hallucination. It creates character replacements like Xerox's old flawed compression algorithm. At least this my experience with Gemini 2.0 Flash. It was a screenshot of a webpage, too.
        * Graybeards like Tessaract has moved to neural network based pipelines, and they're re-inventing and improving themselves.
        * I was planning to train Tessaract with my own hand writing, but if OCR4All can handle that, I'll be happy.

    * Tessercact + Pandoc for document text extraction all in one
