Learning Programming
====================


* [5 Pillars of Learning Programming](https://www.rainerhahnekamp.com/en/5-pillars-of-learning-programming/)
    * Test Driven Development
        * > Beginners shouldn’t write tests. This would be too much for their basic skill levels. Instead, they should learn how to use and work with tests.
    * Fundamentals First (Don't launch into a library or framework)
    * Libraries and Frameworks (most code has already been written)
    * Master and Apprentice
    * Challenge and Motivation
        * > The main goal of an exercise is not to entertain. It should be created around a particular technique and should help the students to understand that technique. Motivation is good, but not at the sacrifice of content.

* [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) - Designing a programming system for understanding programs - Bret Victor (2012)
    * An essay on features lacking of modern development environments to teach people coding
    * Suggest help tags, visualising time and state in IDE.
    * Beautifully presented
    * References prior systems like Logo, Hypercard, Smalltalk
    * Summary
        * Visualise _data/state_ not _code_
        * Does the environment allow the learner to...
            * read the vocabulary? -- Is meaning transparent? Is meaning explained in context, by showing and telling?
            * follow the flow? -- Is time visible and tangible? At all meaningful granularities?
            * see the state? -- Does the environment show the data? Show comparisons? Is hidden state eliminated?
            * create by reacting? -- Is something on screen as soon as possible? Is the parts bucket on the floor?
            * create by abstracting? -- Can the programmer start concrete, then generalize?
        * Does the language provide...
            * identity and metaphor? -- Is the computer's world connected to the programmer's world?
            * decomposition? -- Can the programmer break down her thoughts into mind-sized pieces?
            * recomposition? -- Can the programmer put diverse pieces together?
            * readability? -- Is meaning transparent?




My approach
* language-cheat-sheet
    * fundamental resource
* Guided one off projects - build something real
* guided examples mapped to theory
    * autonomy/responsibility
