Logical Organization

    * > The game consists of a series of levels. In each level, you are tasked with building a component that behaves according to a specification. This component can then be used as a building block in the next level.

    * > I built a programmable 8-bit computer from scratch on breadboards using only simple logic gates. I documented the whole project in a series of YouTube videos and on this web site. Watch this video for an introduction:

    * > Computer architecture is awash with concepts that are fundamental to computer science generally and which do not appear in other parts of the undergraduate curriculum. A course in computer architecture can provide a suitable forum for incorporating fundamental principles in the CS curriculum
    * > To me this is how computer architectures should be taught, a journey from being to end, no hidden details, just simple fundamental computer science, that hopefully everyone can understand.

    * > we will be taking a look at how a computer works, down to the basic boolean algebra. To begin with, we need to take a look at how boolean algebra works, this will lead us into truth tables, and simple schematics. Building from these schematics we will look at Karnaugh maps, and higer level implementation. This higher level implementation will then be used to create an Arithmetic Logic Unit--the brains in a computer. We will end by desiging some simple memory schemes, the final stage in building a processor. By the end of this article, we will design a fully functional processor.
