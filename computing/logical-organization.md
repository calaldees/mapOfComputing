* [Simple CPU design](http://www.simplecpudesign.com/)
    * > Computer architecture is awash with concepts that are fundamental to computer science generally and which do not appear in other parts of the undergraduate curriculum. A course in computer architecture can provide a suitable forum for incorporating fundamental principles in the CS curriculum
