Web Assembly
============

WebASMmbly
WasmMVP (first implemenatation) -> WasmGC

* [[wasix]]
* [[containerisation-WASM]]

C applications can be compiled to webassembly target.
The future!

    * Compile `a+b` in `C` and see what the code is compiled

    Escape analysis to move heap allocations to locals.
    Devirtualization to turn indirect calls into direct ones (that can then be inlined, potentially).
    More powerful global dead code elimination.
    Whole-program type-aware content flow analysis (GUFA).
    Cast optimizations such as removing redundant casts and moving them to earlier locations.
    Type pruning.
    Type merging.
    Type refining (for locals, globals, fields, and signatures).

    * is a x86 to WebAssembly virtualization technology
    * can virtualize native executables or full operating systems
    * can run any x86 application, fully client side

    * Rust is the most popular compiled labguage
    * Strangely Compiling a javascript runtime in WASM and executing JS code is reasonably feasable

Python (in browser)
------
* [brython](https://brython.info/) - Python3 in the browser instead of javascript
* [Introducing PyScript](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/898452/357b195db1ecce28/)
    * ```html
        <py-script>
            print("Hello PyCon 2022!")
        </py-script>
        ```

    * Big issue with WASM python is librarys. A wheelhouse for native python WASM?
