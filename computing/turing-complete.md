Turing Complete
===============

What is required for a machine to be Turing Complete

* [Turing Incomplete Languages](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/11/turing-incomplete-languages.html)
    1. Ban recursion and unbounded loops. Proclaim the language is "Turing incomplete" and that all programs terminate.
    2. Declare that Turing incomplete programs are simpler. Have non-technical people conflate terminate quickly with terminate eventually.
    3. Realise lacking recursion makes things incredibly clunky to express, turning simple problems into brain teasers.
    4. Add recursion.
    5. Realise that the everything is better.

* [Wolfram 2,3 turing machine prize](https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/index.html)
    * The machine has 2 states and 3 colors, and is 596440 in Wolfram's numbering scheme.
    * If it is universal then it is the smallest universal Turing machine that exists.
