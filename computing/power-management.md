================

Laptop power efficency of CPU's is very important

* x86 [[cpu]] kept piling on more stuff (branch prediction). Every transistor takes power and produces heat.
* Power management is part hardware and part software

* Apple S1 and S3 have high speed cores and low speed core that can be turned on an off with software instantly
