SSH

* [TinySSH](https://github.com/janmojzis/tinyssh)
    *  is small server (less than 100000 words of code) 

Key Pairs

* [OpenSSH Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://www.openssh.com/pq.html) 2025
    * Quantum computers could blow away all current encryption
    * Store-now -> decrypt later. People are hording lots of encrypted data today with the idea that in 15 years time they can decrypt it all!
    * So the idea is to raise the bar of our current cryptography algorithms in advance of this

```bash
    # Note: Keys will only work is ~/.ssh and ~/ have correct Permissions
    chmod go-w ~/
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh

    ssh-keygen -t rsa  # consider post quantum secure
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    nano ~/.ssh/config
        Host *
            UseKeychain yes
            AddKeysToAgent yes
            IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        Host example_host
            HostName example.server.net
            Port 12422
            User special
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub example_host  # or user@example.com
    # ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  # ssh-copy-id -> modifies `authorized_keys` to add public keys of allowed passwordless users

    # Port forwarding Socks Proxy - on local client
    ssh -D 8999 dreamhost
    # firefox SOCKSv5 with DNS

    # To port forward
    ssh -L 5672:10.73.146.211:5672 username@hostname
