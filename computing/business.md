    * > For example, an investor I know once told the male CEO of a company he’d funded that his female co-founder seemed better-suited for the job of CEO. Ultimately they swapped roles and their company went on to do quite well. This same investor had similar concerns about another team he’d funded, but this time, the genders were reversed: the CEO was a woman and her cofounder that the investor thought should be CEO was a man. This time, he said nothing. Since he hadn’t invested much money, he decided he’d rather say nothing than risk being accused of sexism. The company did, in fact, wind up doing badly.
    * > When the consequences of something happening are horribly extreme, you only need a few instances to make people change their behavior. And the consequences of being accused of sexism by an online mob have now become so extreme that many investors don’t want to risk it anymore. All they have to do is offend the wrong person and their reputation could be permanently damaged.² Anyone could make a false accusation, so when investors meet you, they have to assume—until they can tell otherwise—that you might be a worst case scenario.³
