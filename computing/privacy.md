    * > Professor Daniel Solove examines the nothing to hide argument. When asked about government surveillance and data mining, many people respond by declaring: "I've got nothing to hide." According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private. The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing. In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings.

    * Increasingly Competitive and commercial space as governments and companies moved in. A space less for the individual
    * Decentralised ot centralised
    * Even if you setup your own email server - when you send an email - google has a copy of it because the recipients have gmail accounts
    * No process - if your gmail account goes - your stranded - you are not a google customer

    * how many pedophiles and terrorists are there?
    * preasure can be applied to companies. Compaines can go beyond what the law affords and take action against these minority groups. Compaines are advertising platoforms and have to bow to pressure.
