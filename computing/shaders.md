HLSL

The language we use to write pixel shaders is called HLSL. It's a C-like language, with some restrictions. You can't allocate memory, use pointers or recursion. What you get access to is computing power in the teraflop range on decently recent GPUs. This means writing real-time raytracers or other cool effects are in the realm of possibility.
