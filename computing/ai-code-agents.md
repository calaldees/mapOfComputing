AI Code Agents
==============

* [agents.md](https://agents.md/)
    * Think of AGENTS.md as a README for agents: a dedicated, predictable place to provide the context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project.

    * > give up on editor-based agentic pairing in favor of asynchronous workflows like GitHub's new Coding Agent, whose work you can also review via pull request
    * > Continue to practice pair-programming with your editor, but throttle down from the semi-autonomous "Agent" mode to the turn-based "Edit" or "Ask" modes. You'll go slower, and that's the point. Also, just like pairing with humans, try to establish a rigorously consistent workflow as opposed to only reaching for AI to troubleshoot
    * > My advice to the AI tool-makers would be to introduce features to make pairing with an AI agent more qualitatively similar to pairing with a human.

* See [[ai-local]] for example of local code agent
