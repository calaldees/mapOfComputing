What is a hash

Where is it used

Why

* https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-simplest-example-of-a-hash-function
* FNV1
* [FNV-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function)
* [PolymurHash](https://github.com/orlp/polymur-hash) is a 64-bit universal hash function designed for use in hash tables. It has a couple desirable properties:
    * 32bytes memory, mathmatically proven low colision, 49bytes = 21 cylces

MD5
SHA1
SHA-2 SHA256?
Argon2



Fast as possible - uniform as possible

[We Didn't Encrypt Your Password, We Hashed It. Here's What That Means:](https://www.troyhunt.com/we-didnt-encrypt-your-password-we-hashed-it-heres-what-that-means/)
> A password hash is a representation of your password that can't be reversed, but the original password may still be determined if someone hashes it again and gets the same result.

* [SHA-1 ‘Fully and Practically Broken’ By New Collision](https://duo.com/decipher/sha-1-fully-and-practically-broken-by-new-collision) 2020
    * > Our work show that SHA-1 is now fully and practically broken for use in digital signatures. GPU technology improvements and general computation cost decrease will quickly render our attack even cheaper, making it basically possible for any ill-intentioned attacker in the very near future

* [Argon2](https://argon2.online/) - Hash Generator & Verifier
    * Generate password hashes with Argon2 algorithm, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition
    * Argon2 is cryptographic hashing algorithm, most recommended for password hashing.
    * Argon2 has 6 input parameters: password, salt, memory cost (the memory usage of the algorithm), time cost (the execution time of the algorithm and the number of iterations), parallelism factor (the number of parallel threads), hash length.
