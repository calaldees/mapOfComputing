[We Didn't Encrypt Your Password, We Hashed It. Here's What That Means:](https://www.troyhunt.com/we-didnt-encrypt-your-password-we-hashed-it-heres-what-that-means/)
> A password hash is a representation of your password that can't be reversed, but the original password may still be determined if someone hashes it again and gets the same result.

* [Argon2](https://argon2.online/) - Hash Generator & Verifier
    * Generate password hashes with Argon2 algorithm, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition
    * Argon2 is cryptographic hashing algorithm, most recommended for password hashing.
    * Argon2 has 6 input parameters: password, salt, memory cost (the memory usage of the algorithm), time cost (the execution time of the algorithm and the number of iterations), parallelism factor (the number of parallel threads), hash length.
